# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview 
In this project, I used statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to analyze automative dataset. The analysis is done in R programming language. 

## Linear Regression 
From the linear regression data analysis we see that vehicle length and ground clearance has the least amount of non-random variance to the linear model. 

The R^2 value of this model is about 71.49%, which can be considered an efficient prediction of the MechaCar datasets. 

## T-Test 
The t-test reveals that the p-value is above the significance level of 0.05 therefore the null hypothesis can not be rejected because there is not sufficient evidence. Therefore, the conclusion is that PSI in the manufactoring lots is similar to the population means across the population that is all the manufactoring lots. 

## Null Hypothesis 
The null hypothesis of this dataset is that each manufactor lot is statistically different from the population of manufactors.
